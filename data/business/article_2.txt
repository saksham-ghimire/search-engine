According to international news agencies, gold was bound for its first quarterly decline in three, squeezed by expectations for more US interest rate hikes, while moderate inflation prints provided some support on Friday.

Prices have shed 2.5 per cent this quarter, dropping from levels just shy of all-time highs at $2,072 in May, caused by nervousness about the health of the US banking sector, to below $1,900 on Thursday. The dollar index and 10-year Treasury yields were both set to gain this quarter, eroding gold's appeal for investors holding other currencies.
